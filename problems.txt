Current problems with the crawler that we may want to fix include:

1) A redirect with a location header that does not specify protocol (i.e.
http) will simply be appended to current url. A redirect is only truly
followed if the protocol is specified.

2) The above applies also to a regular html link (i.e. <a href=...). The
protocol must be included if it is a link to a new domain, otherwise the url will be appended to current
path. 

3) Does not query a specific port when specified in the url (i.e.
google.com:8080). It does not parse this correctly.
